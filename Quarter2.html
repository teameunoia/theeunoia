  <h3>EG 8-9: Streaming Tools </h3>
<p>Our group has chosen to use OBS Studio to be the broadcasting software as it is…</p>
<p>1. Beginner Friendly</p>
<p>2. One of our group members have it already downloaded</p>
<p>3. We have used it before as a group</p>
<p>The equipment we will use are…</p>
<p>Our own device - as we need this to be able to stream and have our cameras</p>
<p>Our own microphones - as we will do a podcast, we will have to talk</p>
<p>Stable internet connection - One of the basic needs to be able to give a good stream</p>
