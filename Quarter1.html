          <h2>Viewers analysis for each streaming category</h2>
          <p>  In September. 19 2022 until September. 23 2022, We conducted a survey about three(3) different kinds of streaming categories; Vlogs, Q&A/Reaction Videos, and Livestream/Podcast. 
          </p>
          <p>Out of 40 respondents, 50% of the respondents prefer watching vlogs because they enjoy watching the life of people, 27.5% of the respondents prefer watching Q&A/Reaction videos because they enjoy seeing creators’ reactions through questions or a certain topic (e.g music video, tv show, game, etc.), and lastly 22.5% of the respondents prefer watching live streams/podcasts because of its rawness and/or because they enjoy watching content about gaming. Few of the respondents have stated that they like podcasts because it’s like a radio show and they like the way it motivates them. In conclusion, the respondents prefer their chosen streaming category due to the fact that they get entertainment, knowledge, and motivation. 
          </p>

          <h2>Need of viewers</h2>
          <p>The streamer could have a sense of community, interactivity and emotional support positively affects viewer's social presence, leading to viewers’ watching live streaming. Furthermore, streamer attractiveness plays a significant moderating role between social presence and live streaming watching.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>Characteristics of a good stream</h2>
          <p>A good stream consists of consistency in updates, quality, behavior and environment. Viewers tend to follow along with creators who have genuine interest in what they’re doing, that’s why constant updates or uploads keeps the ‘hype’ up. Of course the hype won’t be there if the quality isn’t the greatest. Quality of video, quality of audio, quality of the main content matters. No viewers want to spend their time watching low quality content–unless they don’t like you and/or want to create some meme about you– but all things considered, good quality is equivalent to good outcome. Last but not the least, a creator’s behavior and the environment they build together with their audience also matter. As audiences follow, as a community becomes bigger, toxicity is something unavoidable. You, as the content creator, is an influence to your audience in which you should also mark good behavior and manners. Your personal life shouldn’t be invaded either, so do make sure your audience knows that. You are one’s role model, and you don't take that for granted.
